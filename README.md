## Learning how to learn and how to solve problems
### Fail elegantly
1. Making mistakes is the only way to innovate
2. If you cannot solve the problem don't sit there and wait, instead
    - Guess! Guess a small proportion of the problem.
    - Solve a simpler version of the problem

### Heuristics
+ Wise people begin fron the end, and a fool end at the beginning.Use unknown as known and start mixing
    + If AB=AC, CD//DE, Conclusion: Try prove ABCD Parallelogram
    + If ABCD is Parallelogram, THEN AB, CD
    + It works before having a assumption conclusion from unknown to known, now 
    you can more live in the present, you attention work on current self to change
    based on the assumption, you also work on long-term memory to change yourself
    how to connect past long term to potential furture
    + It works because it puts your working memory and long-term memory, left and 
    right brain in a cooperative manner
+ Algo of algo:
    + Eyes fixing on the unknown, but you cannot lose your peripheral vision on input data
    and constraints
    + Describe the problem in "given, when, then" a sentence with an example
    + Think in specialized examples
    + Describe you algo in a sentence(Manipulate input, repeately or recursively until, parse the intermediate
    data structure)
    + Try retrieve the close template
### You cannot jump into problem without ...ï¼Ÿ
1. You cannot start coing with out rephrasing problems in your own words
2. You cannot jump into building solution unless you generate specialized test cases
3. You cannot jump into building solution unless you describe a brute force solution
    + Search, enumerate 1 element and compare to definition
    + Assume f(n-1) works, and extend to f(n)

### Training Principles:
+ Reduce the retrival strength and maximizing gaining in storage strength
+ Output more and input less(Can you generate the content by yourself)
+ Feynman Technique
    + scope of concept
    + use your own words and explain to a student with freshman student knowledge base
+ Consume information in chunks, the context of chunks so you know when to use it
+ Think about testing(generating data)
+ Think abour debugging(how it can adapt to more change)
