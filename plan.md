A fourth moment bet is long or short the volatility of volatility. It could be achieved
either with out-of-the-money options or with calendars. Example: A ratio "backspread"
or reverse spread is a method that includes the buying of out-of-the-money options in
large amounts and the selling of smaller amounts of at-the-money but making sure the
trade satisfies the "credit" rule (i.e., the trade initially generates a positive cash flow).
The credit rule is more difficult to interpret when one uses in-the-money options. In that
case, one should deduct the present value of the intrinsic part of every option using the
put-call parity rule to equate them with out-of-the-money.

The trade shown in Figure 24.1 was accomplished with the purchase of both out-of-the-
money puts and out-of-the-money calls and the selling of smaller amounts of at-the-
money straddles of the same maturity.
