## 隐规则
Think of trading as a gane and that a mistake is not following the rules(dao) of the game. You should review your rules at the beginning of the day and review your trading at the end of the day. If you followed your rules, even if you lost
money, pat yourself on the back. If you didn’t follow your rules, then
mentally rehearse what you did and give yourself more appropriate choices
in the future.

Should only put ten rules into it, every time you add after 10, then you should delete 1.

## 生活的动态平衡
- 健康快乐 = 长寿(减少病痛) + 良好的人际关系 + 财富
- 长寿 = 锻炼 + 睡眠 + 节食
- 锻炼 = 高强度间隔性 + 休息 + 筋骨力积极恢复

### 财富
- 财富 = 现金流 + 资产 * 资产回报(ROI)
- 现金流 = 问责 + 专有知识 + 杠杆
- 问责 = 躬身入局风险 + 个人品牌
- 躬身入局风险 = 截断左尾(爆炸) + 赔付函数不单调递增和递减 + 超过二阶效应(峰度与偏度)
- 专有知识 = 无法量化复制的技能 + 第一手历史公共知识
- 杠杆 = 人 + 资本 + 知识产权 + 媒体 + 算力
- 第一手公共知识 = 犯错误的地方 + 为什么问题会形成 + 必须先自己观察行动和思考后阅读

### 社会部落关系
9. 良好的人际关系 = 率先友善谋求共赢 + 可被激怒 + 不嫉妒 + 简单 + 能原谅

### 寿——生物健康
1. Diet(No sugar, less grains, lots of vegetables, lots of fruits, a little bit meat and nuts)
2. Sleep(No night screen exposure)
3. Exercise(No slow cardio, go compound, heavy and fast without injurying yourself)

### 福——家庭和社会关系
1. No jealous(Congratulate, appreciate and curious about other peoples' success)
2. Nature will unapologetically weed your genes out of existence if you don't take action and learn to attrach women now.
3. Believe nothing about what she says and don't try to convince or engage her in a logical level. Observe her facial expressions, body postures, gestures and engage her in an emotion level.

### 禄——财富智慧资粮
1. Love to loss money now(for valuable information and much bigger win later).
2. Good trade and bad trade is different from winning trade and losing trade. Good trade can lose money on any individual trade as long as it will be profitable(at an risk acceptance level) when repeated mutiple times.
3. You are not get paid for being right(not the trade when you are wrong, but the money you make is not big enough when you are right).
4. You are taking time probability risk(1000 days) not ensemble probability risk(a collection of 1000 people).
